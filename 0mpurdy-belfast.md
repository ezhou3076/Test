# Recommendations for Belfast

### Places to eat

 - Boojum
 - Pizza Jazz (good for a low budget)
 - Slums, Street Food [Website](https://github.com/githubteacher/developers-jan.git)

All restaurants have a vegetarian option, but Slums probably has the best

### Things to do

  - Crumlin Road Gaol
  - Titanic museum
 
A little bit more of a drive but worth visiting (possibly at the same time)

  - Giant's Causeway
  - Carrick-a-rede rope bridge
